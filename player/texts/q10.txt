Inspect this C code that uses the cryptographic primitives from last discussion
to generate encrypt some data:
```
// Assume secret has already been derived
char data[] = "Hello world!";
char cipher[255];
size_t cipher_size = encrypt_data(data, sizeof(data), cipher);
```
This code is supposed to encrypt "Hello world!", but there's a fatal flaw. What
parameter is missing? 
(Don't write out the entire function, just the missing parameter. Hint: it's just
two lowercase characters.)
