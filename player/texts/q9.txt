Inspect this C code that uses the cryptographic primitives from last discussion
to generate a shared secret on the server side:
```
// Assume public key of client is loaded
char* client_cert;
int length;

load_private_key("priv_key.der");

derive_secret();
```
There's a line missing before `derive_secret`. Write out that line.
(Use no spaces and remember the semicolon.)
