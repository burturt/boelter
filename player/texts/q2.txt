Assume Host A and Host B are on a private network communicating through IP tunneling. A has private IP 172.16.45.90, B has private IP 168.20.30.40, and routers R1 and R2 have public IPs 87.204.189.33 and 203.128.56.77, respectively. At position 2, what are the source and destination addresses for a packet sent from A to B (src; dest)?
